      // this is how we define a function

        alert("Hello User!");
      }*/

      // this is how we declare a function which has some code init
      //this is not shown in the browser until we call it

      // to call a function we just use its name followed by parentheses
      // functions are used for resuing code - to call them multiple times
      // and save some typing! instead of typing it everytime we need it we just type the code inside a function one time
      // and call the function whenever we need it wherever we need it

      // a return satement ends a function and can send data back to where the function was called
      // simply a return statement gets a value out of a function

      // we can also pass data into functions
      // via parameters and get data back via return statements
      // so return statements send data out of functions meanwhile parameters send data into functions

      // in example of parameters we will make a function that calculates the tax in a product that we buy in a cart 
      // this includes in the final project of this practice session which is a amazon project

      function calculateTax(costParameter) {
        
      }
