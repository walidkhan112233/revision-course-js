      // Boolean values can be either true or false
      console.log(5 === 6); // false
      console.log(5 < 6); // true

      // The result of a comparison is a boolean value
      // use === for strict equality comparison instead of == which converts types

      console.log(5 == "5"); // true (not strict)
      console.log(5 === "5"); // false (strict)
      //always use === to avoid unexpected type coercion

      // if statement example
      // '5' == 5  // true but '5' === 5 // false bcz of type difference  ((one is string and the  other is number))

      if (5 > 3) {
        // if condition is true, the block runs ifnot it is skipped and goes to else
        console.log("5 is greater than 3");

      /* ternary operater example:

    in if statements we write like this 

      let result;

       if (1 + 2 === 3) {
       result = true;
      } else {
        result = false;

      // shortcut to this in ternary operator will be
      // advantage of ternary operator is that it makes code concise and readable and short
      //and we can assign  the condition statements directly in variable too

      let result = 1 + 3 > 3 ? true : false;
      // statement before the ? is the condition
      // statement after ? is what to do if condition is true
      // statement after : is what to do if condition is false
      console.log(result);

      /* ternary operator ( ? : ) , Guard operator (&&) and Deafult operator (||) are just shortcut of if statements 
      for concise code and to save some extra typing*/

      // Example of Guard operator (&&)
      // Guard operator have a speacial feature as called short circuit evaluation
      // it stops evaluating as soon as it finds the first false condition even if its the first one it doesnt even run the code after it
      //for example:
      const message = false && console.log("2nd value");
      // in console nothing will be printed bcz first value is false so it stops evaluating further
      //now if we console
      console.log(message); // false
      // now if we make first value true
      const message2 = true && console.log("2nd value");
      // console will print 2nd value bcz first value is true so it evaluates further
      // this is how guard operator works

      // Example of Default operator (||)
      // Default operator also have a speacial feature as called short circuit evaluation
      // it stops evaluating as soon as it finds the first true condition even if its the first
      //for example:
      const msg = true || console.log("value");
      console.log(msg); // true
      // now if we make first value false
      const msg2 = false || console.log("22 value");
      // console will print 22 value bcz first value is false so it evaluates further
      // this is how default operator works
